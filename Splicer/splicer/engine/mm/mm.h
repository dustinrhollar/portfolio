@brief: just kidding. This isn't brief.

Memory Manager is an interface to heap allocation
for a program. There are two types of memory provide:
1. Permanant Storage
2. Transient Storage

Permanant Storage is the default memory storage for the
managaer unless otherwise specified. This type of storage
is for allocations that are not expected to be freed/allocated
on regular basis. Permanant Storage managed through a
Free List Allocator.

Transient Storage is temporary storage that is expected
to be freed on a regular basis. For example, a good usage
would be to use per-Frame allocations for transient storage.
Internally, a Linear Allocator is used to manage Transient
Memory, which means that memory is freed (reset) for the
entire Allocator rather than on a per-allocation basis.
Allocations from Transient Storage should not call Free(),
but call Reset() for the entire allocator. If it is expected
that a user need to free on a per-allocation basis, it is
recommended that a sub-allocator is requested from Transient
Memory and memory is managed through the sub-allocator instead.

To initialize memory manager, a size of allocation and the size
of transient memory is requested. Note that "size of allocation"
refers to the entire memory block that will be allocated. The size
of permanant storage will be:
          (size of allocation) - (size of transient memory)

Three internal pointers are managed within the Memory Manager.
1. void *GlobalMemory: pointer to the start of the global allocated memory
2. FreeListAllocator *PermanantStorage: pointer to the FreeListAllocator object
3. LinearAllocator *TransientStorage: pointer to the LinearAllocator object

Since pointers cannot be created on the stack, space for them must
be allocated at runtime. In order to allocate space for these two objects,
additional memory is appended to the front of the GlobalMemory. If the Memory
Manager is intialized with M bytes, then a total allocation of size:
            M + sizeof(FreeListAllocator) + sizeof(LinearAllocator)
is made. Therefore, the GlobalMemory block will have the following memory layout:

     //                                                  | ---------- Requested Size --------- |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| FreeListAllocator Object | LinearAllocator object | Transient Memory | Permanant Memory |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Diagram not to scale :p

When shutting down the Memory Manager, it is expected that a user has
managed memory appropriately. While this is not a concern for
TransientMemory (allocator is simply reset), PermanantMemory will
trigger an assertion error if there are allocations that have not
been freed. This is done in order to assist users in detecting
memory leaks at program shutdown. If this not behavior a user
desires, then remove the lines in "ShutdownMemoryManager" that call
the destructors for the PermanantMemory and Transient memory in
"mm.cpp".
