## About

This repository is a collection of projects or utilities that I have worked on over the past few years. Information about each project can be found below.

1. [Common](https://github.com/dustinrhollar/portfolio/tree/main/Common) is a suite of common utilities that I often use across all projects. This includes data structures like strings, hash functions, and a vector math library.
2. [ECS](https://github.com/dustinrhollar/portfolio/tree/main/ECS) is an experiment for a generic Entity Component System architecture.  
3. [Heightmap CUDA](https://github.com/dustinrhollar/portfolio/tree/main/HeightmapCUDA) is a demonstration on how to leverage interopability between OpenGL, C++, and CUDA. 
4. [LOD Terrain](https://github.com/dustinrhollar/portfolio/tree/main/LODTerrain) is a research project I worked on for my first semester of Computer Graphics at University. It showcases procedural terrain generation, dynamic level of detail, and mesh generation.
5. [Low Poly Terrain](https://github.com/dustinrhollar/portfolio/tree/main/LowPolyTerrainGen) is a low poly renderer for terrain and water.
6. [Platform API](https://github.com/dustinrhollar/portfolio/tree/main/PlatformApi) is a cross platform utility for Windows and X11. 
7. [Raytracer](https://github.com/dustinrhollar/portfolio/tree/main/Raytracer) is a raytracer based on "Raytracing in One Weekend" that uses an async job system to speed up rendering.

Many of these demos are currently being rewritten into a single project. See [Maple Terrain](https://github.com/dustinrhollar/MapleTerrain) for more info.
